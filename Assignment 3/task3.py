# Make a dictionary called cities. Use the names of three cities as keys in your dictionary. Create a dictionary of information about each city
# and include the country that the city is in, its approximate population,
# and one fact about that city. The keys for each cityâ€™s dictionary should be something like country, population, 
# and fact. Print the name of each city 
# and all of the information you have stored about it.
